Some open-source health related apps for Android I really like.

* Loop Habit Tracker: https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits
  * It's a simple app for reminding you about stuff you should or shouldn't be doing.

* Plees Tracker: https://github.com/vmiklos/plees-tracker
  * Again a very simple app, for keeping track of how much you sleep.

* Paseo: https://gitlab.com/pardomi/paseo
  * App for counting approximately how many steps you've walked. Minimal and seems to be privacy oriented.
